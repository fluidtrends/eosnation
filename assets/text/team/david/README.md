**DAVID REQUENEZ - CMO**

David has a background in business, education, and for the past several years, blockchain.  David worked in education for 8 years until recently going full time into EOS and EOS Nation.  David has worked on several business start-ups in his career, from business consulting to education.  Inspired by great people and always looking towards the future, David became fully captivated by Dan Larimerâ€™s vision of what EOS could become.  

David has always been interested in economics, following notable economists like Marc Faber, Peter Schiff and Milton Friedman.  Having lived through the internet bubble of 2001 and the housing crash and financial crisis of 2008, David hopes that the transparency that comes with blockchain could bolster free-market economies and reduce market manipulation.
