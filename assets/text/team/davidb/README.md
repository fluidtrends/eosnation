**DAVID BIGLEY**

Being a lover of freedom and entrepreneurship, David Bigley started a landscaping business in 2013 after earning his bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in Business Studies. Intrigued with Bitcoin and the implications of a decentralized, trustless monetary system, he began pursuing a deeper understanding of the blockchain space beginning in the summer of '17. A new passion had been ignited.  The implications of Moore's Law revealed to him the importance and urgency of steering technology in a positive direction to empower people and enrich the human experience. 

Before long, David came across an interview with the EOSIO creator, Dan Larimer. Dan's philosophy of voluntary association and life mission "to find free market solutions to secure life, liberty, and property for all" greatly resonated with him. Not only was Dan's philosophy aligned with his own, but Dan’s expertise and success in building other projects like Bitshares & Steemit was incredibly promising. The EOSIO implementation of solutions to the problems in scalability, governance, adaptability, and the incentive structures present on the EOSIO platform made it apparent that EOSIO was in a unique position to be the leading infrastructure for innovation of decentralized applications. David is happy to be working with EOS Nation to grow the EOS community in the Philadelphia region.  David’s purpose backed with passion is to educate others on all things EOSIO!
