**YVES LA ROSE - CEO**

Yves began his journey into computers at a very young age, building his first computer at 6 years old and programed his first game at the age of 7. Yves has always had a deep ideological relationship with computers and their role in decentralization. Yves began his university studies in software engineering, but quickly realized the human aspect was where his heart resided. After completing studies in psychology and pure sciences, Yves bridged the gap by focusing on perceptual and computational neuropsychology. After starting to mine Bitcoin in 2010, Yves eventually realized that Proof of Work would not be able to provide him with the decentralization dream he was so fond of. Yves used his bitcoins to buy various computer parts and forgot about Bitcoin for a few years until he co-founded a crypto education group in 2016. In his professional life, Yves worked for the Canadian Federal Government as an economist and a policy advisor, and then worked in communications for an elected National political representative in Canada. Yves left National politics to pursue his passion of decentralization, cryptoassets and EOS â€“ founding EOS Nation in February 2018. Yves is fluent in Japanese having spent the early part of his formative adult years living in Japan.
