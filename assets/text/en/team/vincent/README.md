**VINCENT GRENIER, P.Eng - CFO**

Passionate about business finance, management and systems, Vincent Grenier worked as a structural engineer where he helped build the accounting and management software.  His interest in investing eventually led him to Bitcoin and then EOSIO.  Combining his enthusiasm with his desire to educate the public about the vast potential of EOSIO, Vincent was a staple of the early online EOS communities. Before the idea of EOS Nation was even born, Vincent was already building and educating EOS communities online and organising local meetups.  While Vincent manages important legal and financial aspects of EOS Nation, he is also still leading various education initiatives.  He is currently working online with other Block Producers to build a cohesive EOSIO educational platform while at the same time continuing to generate educational content for the French community.  He has hosted over 10 meetups across Quebec, France and Switzerland, done multiple interviews with various French communities and created tutorial videos on our EOS Nation FR YouTube page.
